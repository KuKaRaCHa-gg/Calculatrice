# üñ© JavaFX Calculator

This is my **first JavaFX project** using **FXML**, where I created a simple calculator. The project demonstrates the basics of JavaFX application development, including designing a user interface with FXML and managing interactions through controllers.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`Main.java`**: The main entry point that launches the JavaFX application.
- **`HelloApplication.java`**: Handles the setup and initialization of the JavaFX application.
- **`HelloController.java`**: Contains the logic for handling user interactions and calculator functionality.
- **`hello-view.fxml`**: Defines the graphical user interface layout using FXML.
- **`module-info.java`**: Specifies the module dependencies required for the project.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Basic Calculations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **FXML Design**: The user interface is built using a clean and structured FXML layout.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Each button triggers corresponding operations in the controller.
- **JavaFX Integration**: Leverages the JavaFX framework for smooth and responsive UI.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Ensure you have JavaFX properly set up in your environment.
Run Main.java to start the calculator application.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
JavaFX: Framework for building desktop applications with a modern UI.
FXML: XML-based structure for defining the user interface layout.
Java: The programming language used for the logic and functionality.
